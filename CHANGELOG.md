# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Real Hyperliquid Market-by-Order (MBO) feed ingestion: a confirmed `FEEDS` row
  (`233.84.178.15`, ports `10201`/`10202`/`10203`, depth-only) re-served as full-state
  `depth`. `--feed <venue>` now selects every protocol feed for that venue.
- Per-feed `emit_trades` flag so a venue carried by both Top-of-Book and Market-by-Order
  does not double-emit `trade` messages (Top-of-Book owns trades; MBO is depth-only).
- End-to-end test suite that drives the release binary over loopback multicast and asserts
  the WebSocket output contract, with deduplication-oracle assertions for future work.

### Changed
- Feed registry is keyed by `(venue, kind)` instead of `venue`, so one venue can carry
  multiple protocol feeds.
- Bumped dependencies from the open Dependabot PRs: `tokio-tungstenite`
  0.23 → 0.29, `socket2` 0.5 → 0.6, `nix` 0.29 → 0.31, and the GitHub Actions
  `actions/checkout` (v6.0.3), `docker/login-action` (v4.2.0),
  `docker/setup-buildx-action` (v4.1.0), `docker/build-push-action` (v7.2.0),
  and `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` (v6.2.0). The `tokio-tungstenite`
  0.29 upgrade switched `Message::Text`/`Ping`/`Pong` payloads to
  `Utf8Bytes`/`Bytes`, updated in `src/sinks/ws.rs`.

### Fixed
- Corrected inverted Market-by-Order order-book side constants (`0 = Bid`, `1 = Ask` per
  the edge-feed-spec); bids and asks in `depth` were previously swapped.
- Warn instead of silently clobbering when two feeds for the same `(venue, symbol)` publish
  instrument definitions with different price/quantity exponents.

## [0.1.0]

### Added
- Initial release of `doublezero-edge-connect`: ingests DoubleZero Edge binary
  multicast feeds (Top-of-Book & Trades, Midpoint, Market-by-Order), runs the
  reference-data subscriber state machine, and re-serves normalized market data over a
  WebSocket in the engine-agnostic JSON protocol specified in `PROTOCOL.md` (v1).
